<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) is an open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. 
It is a high-performance and lightweight framework for building distributed systems, allowing clients and servers 
to communicate transparently and efficiently. <br>gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its default interface definition 
language (IDL), which allows for efficient serialization and deserialization of data across different languages and platforms. 
This makes it easier to develop and maintain cross-platform applications with different programming languages. 
<br>gRPC supports multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, Ruby, and more. It also supports 
different types of communication patterns, including unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional 
streaming.</p>

<p>In this assignment, we will go over the basics of gRPC, how to use it to build a chat application between many 
clients, and we will apply that using Java language.</p>
